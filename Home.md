# Clang Built Linux

Clang Built Linux is a renewed effort to get the Linux kernel compiling with Clang.

## Motivation

Improve both code bases by turning them on one another.

## Reporting bugs

Please help us by reporting issues compiling the Linux kernel with Clang.  The project members will help with deciding whether the issue is a kernel or compiler bug.

Please include SHA of latest kernel commit, clang version, and config used when reporting an issue.
